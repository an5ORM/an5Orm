/**
 * The npm and PyPI versions must agree.
 *
 * They are two fields maintained by hand, in two files, and nothing compared
 * them. `an5-orm` was at 1.0.9 on PyPI while `@an5/orm` reached 1.0.12 on npm,
 * because every release bumped package.json and forgot pyproject.toml. The
 * publish job does not fail when it skips an existing version, so each run
 * quietly built and skipped the old one: PyPI had not received a new release
 * through this pipeline at all.
